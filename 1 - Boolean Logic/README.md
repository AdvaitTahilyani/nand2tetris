# Project 1: Building Logical Chips from NAND

## Overview

In this project, I embarked on constructing basic logical gates using only NAND gates, as part of the initial phase of the Nand2Tetris course. The NAND gate is a universal gate, meaning it can be used to create any other standard gate. This approach demonstrates the fundamental versatility and power of the NAND gate in digital logic design.

## Implementation

### Logical Chips Created

Here are the logical chips that I developed using solely the NAND gate.:

- **NOT Gate**
- **AND Gate**:
- **OR Gate**
- **XOR Gate**
- **Mux Gate**
- **DMux Game**


Each of these chips is implemented in a separate `.hdl` file where the internal architecture is defined based on the NAND logic. Some chips have multiple implementations allowing for more inputs or outputs.

### How to Run the Implementation

To run and test the implementations of these logical chips use the hardware simulator at https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip/

## Conclusion

This project highlights the foundational role of NAND gates in digital electronics, illustrating how complex operations can be broken down into simpler, universal operations. By using just the NAND gate, we are able to construct all the essential building blocks of digital logic.
